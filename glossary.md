# DevOps Glossary

## A

### A/B Testing
A method used to compare two or more versions of a webpage, app feature, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better. In A/B testing, users are randomly assigned to different groups, each exposed to a different version (e.g., version A or version B).

The performance of each version is measured based on specific metrics, such as conversion rates, click-through rates, or user engagement. By analyzing the results, organizations can make data-driven decisions on which version to implement more widely. A/B testing is commonly used in digital marketing, product development, and user experience design to optimize outcomes and enhance user satisfaction.

### ACID
An acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are a set of properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
- Atomicity guarantees that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully or none at all, preventing partial updates.
- Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints.
- Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions do not affect each other's execution; changes made by one transaction are not visible to others until they are committed.
- Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

Together, these properties help maintain data integrity and reliability in database systems.

### Ansible

## S

### Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a system, application, or infrastructure to handle increased load or demand by expanding its resources. A scalable system can efficiently grow or shrink based on the workload, without sacrificing performance or stability. Scalability can be achieved in two main ways:
- Vertical scaling (scale-up): Adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to an existing server.
- Horizontal scaling (scale-out): Adding more servers or instances to distribute the load across multiple systems.

Scalability is a critical aspect of system design, especially for applications expected to grow or handle variable loads, such as web services and cloud environments.

- O: Open/Closed Principle – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing code.
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle – Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program.
- I: Interface Segregation Principle – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, promoting the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces.
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).

### Spring Boot

### SSH (Secure Shell)
A cryptographic network protocol used for securely accessing and managing devices over an unsecured network. SSH provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting the data exchanged between the client and server, protecting against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Commonly used for remote login to servers, SSH allows users to execute commands, transfer files, and manage systems securely. It replaces older, less secure protocols like Telnet and FTP. SSH uses public key cryptography for authentication, enabling users to authenticate themselves to a server using either passwords or key pairs.

### Stateful
A term used to describe applications or services that maintain a persistent state across sessions or interactions. In a stateful application, the server retains information about the client's previous interactions, allowing it to provide a customized experience or continuity of operation. This contrasts with stateless applications, where each request is treated independently, and no session information is retained. Stateful services are often used in scenarios where user sessions, data persistence, or transaction management are essential, such as databases or online shopping carts.

### Stateless
A term used to describe applications or services that do not retain any information about previous interactions or sessions. In a stateless architecture, each request from a client is treated independently, with no stored context or session data on the server. This means that every request must contain all the necessary information for the server to fulfill it. Stateless designs simplify scalability and reliability, as servers can handle requests without needing to track client state, making them suitable for cloud-native applications and microservices.
