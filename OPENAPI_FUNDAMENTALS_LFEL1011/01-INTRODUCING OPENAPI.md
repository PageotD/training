# INTRODUCING OPENAPI

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Chapter overview

Many aspects of our daily lives that we oftentimes take for granted are powered by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Our digital world is enabled by the API Economy, an increasingly vast collection of products and services that have one thing in common, namely that their presence in the market is facilitated by providing an API. APIs have grown into a natural mechanism for enabling communication between distributed systems, providing operations and functions that allow organizations to build decentralized platforms, which can scale and grow more effectively.

While many of these APIs can be accessed for free, an increasing number are paid-for offerings. Organizations relying on APIs for critical functionality or business transactions, sometimes paying for access, need an effective way to understand them. Describing the APIs that power these products and services in a manner that is both efficient and scalable is, therefore, crucially important for API providers. Combined with the inherent need to create a shared understanding between API providers and consumers, this need resulted in the creation of API description languages.

API description languages have grown alongside the API Economy. They provide the means to describe and document the shape of an API. While many exist, the OpenAPI Specification has become the most popular and widely used. It allows API providers to create OpenAPI descriptions that power an ecosystem of tools that help API providers and API consumers to publish and consume APIs.

- Discuss what OpenAPI is and why it is important

## 2 Introducing the API economy

### 2.1 The role of APIs

Software has been feasting on the world for over a decade. In this culinary metaphor, Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are the chef's tools for crafting the meal and the silverware we use to devour it. APIs are fundamental to how we do business across many different industries and are a building block in many other technology trends, including crypto, open banking, and AI.

Leveraging APIs has allowed businesses to forge new products and operating models and provide the means to expose them in a way that could only have been dreamed of 30 years ago. They have enabled the general interconnectedness of products and experiences. Many products we take for granted - think Uber and the communication between you, the driver, Uber itself, and where you are in the world - would not exist without the coming together of multiple APIs to locate you, enable messaging between you and the driver and allow you to make a payment. Uber leverages partners in the API ecosystem to provide these features of their ride-hailing offering. They do not build the services to deliver these features that make up your experience with them, even though that option is open to them.

Uber uses products already in the market that are provided exclusively through an API, which Uber integrates into their own applications. This means they can offer these features using tried-and-tested providers without the build overhead in time, cost, or quality.

### 2.2 APIs-as-Product

The APIs-as-products view of the world - and, increasingly, the associated revenues being generated by businesses providing APIs - now dominates the world of APIs. Many organizations take a product management approach to APIs, regardless of whether APIs are revenue-generating, as they are often the subject of shared demand through their base of consumers. API product manager roles are becoming more common, along with backlogs that funnel requirements for a given API. APIs have a lifecycle, and using a product management approach to moving APIs through that lifecycle is an important means to make them successful.

The evolution of the product view of APIs is astonishing in that, at their heart, APIs are a type of software interface that has performed the same role since the dawn of computing, namely the invocation of services and the exchange of data. APIs enable the development of distributed and decentralized systems, and organizations have grown to take advantage of the commercial opportunity of providing paid access to APIs that expose commercial products.

This growth of business models based on APIs is why we hear the phrase the API economy. The API economy is a generalized term that describes businesses bringing their products to market either partially or wholly using APIs. Putting a dollar value on the API economy is impossible because so many businesses participate.

Being an API provider has become almost fundamental to doing business across so many industries and verticals. This growth continues to expand as industries evolve “open” models - often prompted through regulation - that have APIs as a fundamental building block.

The growth in the API economy has primarily been organic and has taken over a decade. This organic growth has resulted in challenges for product and technology teams providing APIs to public audiences over the Internet, often for the first time in a given industry. Meeting these challenges is not just a question of solving technical problems; they are fundamental to doing business in an API-enabled economy.

One of the most fundamental challenges is also one of the most simple: How can we describe our APIs in a way that allows external developers to create software clients and also understand the API’s operations and functionality?

API description languages help meet this challenge.

## 3 Describing APIs

### 3.1 Describing software interfaces

Providing an accurate description of a software interface is not a unique problem. Different styles of software integration have been developed over the years that use a description language to describe their functionality. Other programming languages and software providers use interface description languages (IDL) as a feature to provide appropriate documentation.

The most obvious example, popular around the time the API Economy started to grow, is the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). This IDL is used in software-oriented architectures (SOA) and is a technical description that provides the information required to engineer a software client to call a given operation. These documents are, however, geared towards a specific technology stack and architectural style, largely due to the software vendors involved in the SOA world, which made their extension into other styles of API more difficult.

The growth of the API Economy, being organic in nature, has been much more distributed. The protagonists preferred using familiar technologies and toolsets that did not require specific libraries or software development kits. For example, HTTP is at the core of what is commonly called web APIs because it underpins the Internet, provides an obvious transport mechanism, and has a freely available client in the vast majority of programming languages and platforms. This has been bolstered by the adoption of Representational State Transfer, or REST, as the salient architectural style of API, which is built on top of HTTP.

However, there was a missing piece of the puzzle, namely a means to accurately describe the operations, parameters and payloads that a given API supported. While REST espoused the use of hypermedia to drive discovery and context in consuming web APIs, many API providers and consumers required something that encapsulated the description of an API using a concise mechanism.

This need resulted in the birth of API description languages.

### 3.2 What are API description languages ?

There has been a need to communicate what an API looks like from the early days of the API Economy. The coalescing of providers around HTTP semantics and REST to provide their APIs also solidified what needed to be communicated and how it might be formatted. API description languages, therefore, came into being that provide a document format for expressing the shape of an API. They focus on providing information about the structure of a given API and the properties most important to those who need to understand them, encoded in a machine- and human-readable format such as JSON or YAML.

The properties of the APIs they describe include the following:
- The URLs - often termed endpoints - that the API exposes.
- The HTTP methods supported at each endpoint, loosely termed an operation.
- The parameters expected by each operation including HTTP headers, query parameters and, where supported, by the HTTP method the request body.
- The expected HTTP responses codes.
- The expected response headers for each response code and, where supported, the response body.

In the case of request and response bodies, there is the added complexity of describing the data schematically. In the case of the growth of the API Economy, this has meant seeking an effective means to describe JSON data as it is the most typical content type supported by API providers, again due to the preferences of the API implementers.

Accurately describing the properties of an API has become and continues to be critical to the success of any API provider. One might ask why API providers do not just take a shortcut and share their source code - or the most meaningful portion that describes their interfaces - with external developers to help them understand their APIs. The key point here is that such a practice would make life difficult for developers who do not speak the language and rely on a description of the API through a consumer-friendly interface that does not leak implementation details. What was and continues to be needed is a vendor-neutral specification, agnostic of any programming language that makes for simplicity in describing the capabilities of an API.
